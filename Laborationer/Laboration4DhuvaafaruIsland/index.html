                        <h3>About the Island</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dhuvaafaru is an inhabited island of Maldives located in the eastern edge of Raa
                            Atoll. Resettlement of the island started on 14 December 2008 to inhabit the displaced
                            residents of Kandholhudhoo (Raa Atoll) who were the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean
                            earthquake and tsunami.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The challenging task of resettling the Tsunami victims and establishing a new island
                            community on Dhuvaafaru was undertaken by the International Federation of Red Cross
                            and Red Crescent Societies under an agreement made with the Government of Maldives in
                            May 2005.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though Dhuvaafaru was uninhabited till recent history, there is physical and literary
                            proof of the island being inhabited over 200 years ago.

                        <h3>Etymology</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the local Maldivian Dhivehi language, the island name of Dhuvaafaru is literally
                            translated as "running reef". It is suggested that this name may have been derived
                            from the ever shifting shape of the island’s beach in different monsoons. Even
                            today the shape of the beach and shoreline keeps changing consistently, especially
                            during the rainy season.

                        <h3>Geography</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dhuvaafaru is situated in Raa Atoll which is officially known as North Maalhosmadulu
                            Atoll. The island is located between the atoll capital of Ungoofaaru and Maakurathu.
                            From Dhuvaafaru in a normal boat it takes about 20 minutes to reach atoll capital
                            Ungoofaaru and over 8 hours to reach capital city Male'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dhuvaafaru is the second largest island in Raa Atoll with 44 hectares of land, having
                            a lagoon almost twice the size of the landmass. The island which is less than a meter
                            above sea level was entirely covered with trees until they were cut down for
                            redevelopment.

                        <h3>Transport</h3>
                        <p>
                            As Dhuvaafaru is an island surrounded by sea in every side, transport is mainly based
                            on sea. There are speed boats and normal boats that people use for transport between
                            islands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Larger vessels are used to travel to and from the Capital Male' and for faster
                            transport residents use seaplane service from the only resort located in the atoll.
                            Fishermen use specifically designed vessels to catch fish from the open sea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inland, people normally use bicycles and motorbikes to drive from one place to
                            another. Some locals provide taxi service by car and pickups are also available to
                            transport heavy effects.
                        </p>
