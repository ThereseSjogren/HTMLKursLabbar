            <h2>Skimboarding</h2>
            <p>Skimboarding (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a
             skimboard (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) 
             is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave,
             and ride it back to shore. </p>
            <h2>Types of skimboards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wave Riding Skimboards</li>
                <li>Inland Skimboards</li>
                <li>Flatland Skimboards</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differences between the types</h3>
            <p>
                Wave riding is the style most popular and best recognized in the sport of skimboarding.
                There are more athletes and competitions in wave riding than any other division of skimboarding.
                It is also the hardest and most technical. Today's wave riding boards are a product of years
                of trials and errors.
                There isn't much variation in shape because of this.
            </p>
            <p>Inland boards are generally made of wood and are easy to find at a local surf or skate shop,
             depending on your location.
             Inland boards tend to be made of wood and have a hcl bottom and, therefore, are called "woodies" by wave-riding skimboarders.
             Wood core can boards are quite rugged.
             They are meant for grinding rails and doing tricks.</p>
