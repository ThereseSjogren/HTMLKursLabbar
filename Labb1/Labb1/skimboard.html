            <h3>About skimboarding</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Skimboarding</mark> (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a
                skimboard (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins)
                is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave,
                and ride it back to shore.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of skimboards</h3>

                <li>Flatland or Inland <mark>Skimboarding</mark></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differences between the types</h3>
            <p>
                Wave riding is the style most popular and best recognized in the sport of skimboarding.
                There are more athletes and competitions in wave riding than any other division of skimboarding.
                It is also the <strong>hardest</strong> and <strong>most technical</strong>. Today's wave riding boards are a product of years
                of trials and errors.
                There isn't much variation in shape because of this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inland boards are generally made of wood and are easy to find at a local surf or skate shop,
                depending on your location.
                Inland boards tend to be made of wood and have a hcl bottom and, therefore, are called "woodies" by wave-riding skimboarders.
                Wood core can boards are quite rugged.
                They are meant for grinding rails and doing tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
                They stand up well against rocks and shells, obstacles, and general wear,
                they are great for beginners because they are simple to make and low-price.
                They are also used by a lot of professonal skimboarders and can learn
                how to do a lot more tricks such as a <q>Bigger Spin</q>.

            <h2>Dangers</h2>
            <p>
                There are many types of <strong>dangers</strong> that skimboarders can face on a daily basis.
                It is not uncommon to see fractures or dislocations of the lower limbs,
                some requiring serious medical attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Hamstring injury</em> is also common due to the fast and extreme movement of skimboarder's leg
                when they run toward the water and jump on the board.
                Drowning amongst skimboarders is not as likely as amongst surfers due to the shallow water
                in which skimboarding is usually practiced.

            <h2>Best Locations for skimboarding</h2>
            <p>
                Many consider the center of skimboarding to be located in Laguna Beach,
                California where skimboarding became popular in the late 1920s when lifeguards would skim across
                sand on pieces of wood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other Laguna hot spots consist of Tenth street, West Street, Treasure Island, Thalia Street,
                and Crescent Bay. In Dewey Beach, Delaware, every year the World Amateur Championships of Skimboarding
                are held on New Orleans Street. The Florida Pro/Am is held every year in August, on Vilano Beach, Florida,
                which is known as <strong>the best</strong> East Coast skimboarding <strong>location</strong>.
