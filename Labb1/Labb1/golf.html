                <mark>Golf</mark> is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series
                of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
                <mark>Golf</mark> is one of the few ball games that do not require a standardized playing area.

                <b>Matchplay</b>, two players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is
                called match play. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of
                both players or teams are equal the hole is <q>halved</q> (or tied).
                The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other.
                In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number
                of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead,
                and the remainder of the holes are not played.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Foursome</b> this is played between two teams of two players each,
                in which each team has only <em>one</em> ball and players alternate playing it.
                For example, if players <q>A</q> and <q>B</q> form a team, <q>A</q> tees off on the first hole,
                <q>B</q> will play the second shot, <q>A</q> the third, and so on until the hole is finished.
                On the second hole, <q>B</q> will tee off (regardless who played the last putt on the first hole),
                then <q>A</q> plays the second shot, and so on.
                Foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Fourball</b> this is also played between two teams of two players each,
                but every player plays their own ball and for each team,
                the lower score on each hole counts.
            </p>

            <h2>Play of the game</h2>
            <p>
                Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order.
                A <q>round</q> typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined
                by the course layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. On a nine-hole course,
                players may play a <q>short game</q> playing each hole once,
                or a <q>full round</q> by playing each hole twice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with
                a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). 
                For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to
                place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. 
                A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground
                up to a few centimetres high.
