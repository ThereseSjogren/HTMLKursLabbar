            <h3>About badminton</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Badminton</mark> is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.
                Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game
                are <q>singles</q> (with one player per side) and <q>doubles</q> (with two players per side).
            </p>

            </ul>
            <h3>A little about the equipment</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Racquetes</b>: <mark>Badminton</mark> <em>racquets</em> are lightweight,
                with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95 grams (2.5 and 3.4 ounces)
                not including grip or strings.
                They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite
                (graphite reinforced plastic) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Strings</b>: <mark>Badminton</mark> strings are thin, high performing strings with thicknesses ranging
                from about 0.62 to 0.73 mm. Thicker strings are more durable,
                but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions
                increase power. The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning,
                such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more <i>bouncy</i> and therefore provides more
                <strong>power</strong>. This is in fact incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide
                off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Grip</b>:The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet
                handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with
                <i>one</i> or <i>several</i> grips before applying the final layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Shuttlecock</b>:A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to shuttle; also called a birdie)
                is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape: the cone is formed from
                sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin
                leather or synthetic material. Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to
                reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be
                constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base, and a plastic skirt.
            </p>
                <h4>Testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To test a shuttlecock, hit a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the
                        shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an
                        upward angle and in a direction parallel to the side lines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530 mm and not more
                        than 990 mm short of the other back boundary line.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                <b>Shoes</b>:<mark>Badminton</mark> shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip,
                non-marking materials.
            </p>

            <h3>Spin</h3>
            <p>
                Slicing the shuttlecock so that it spins, however, does have applications,
                and some are particular to <mark>badminton</mark>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction
                    from the direction suggested by the player's racquet or body movement.
                    This is used to deceive opponents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly
                    curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin
                    causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path.
                    This can be used to create dropshots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass
                    the net.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When playing a netshot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over
                    itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a <i>spinning</i>
                    <i>netshot</i> or <i>tumbling netshot</i>. The opponent will be unwilling to address 
                    the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.
                </li>
